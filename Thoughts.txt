- Create the updated_at and created_at fields using a trait => i think this is okay for now

- Create the relationship between the entities

- Configure the doctrine to use sqlite instead if mysql

- To make the example more interesting i might try to allow the user to remove his feedback and only HIS
    based on the IP address,
       - i might need to to store the addresse ip in the DB

       Ok not doing this anymore it could take a lot longer than i thought, instead ill add the item to the wish list and it will be removed if it's already there
       which means the button will toggle state based on the item being in the list or not
        In the DB i'll need a wishlist table which will have the follwing relationships:
        * ManyToMany() product and wishlist
